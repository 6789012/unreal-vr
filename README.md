# UnrealVR

Adds virtual reality support to flatscreen Unreal Engine games

## Releases

None yet. Private alpha tests went okay, but the mod isn't stable enough to release publicly yet

## Rewrite

I'm rewriting literally every component (launcher, libs, core) in Rust. You can find the previous C++ version under a
different branch. That readme has more details on implementation, features, etc.
